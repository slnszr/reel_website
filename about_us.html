    <h1>About Anomalyze</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Anomalyze</strong> is a machine learning-based anomaly detection application focused on analyzing network packet sizes. The system employs a Random Forest classifier trained on labeled traffic data to assess whether a given packet is normal or anomalous. It leverages data preprocessing and resampling techniques to ensure the model is both accurate and generalizable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application offers a real-time web interface where users can input packet sizes and instantly receive classification feedback along with a confidence score. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how intelligent, lightweight models can assist in network traffic analysis and anomaly detection, providing a foundation for future cybersecurity tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tool was developed as part of an academic internship project combining data science, cybersecurity, and software engineering practices.
